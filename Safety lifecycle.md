1. **Phase 0: Risk Assessment**
   - Identify and assess potential hazards to determine the necessary safety measures.

2. **Phase 1: Safety Planning**
   - Develop a comprehensive safety plan, including safety goals, management plans, and roles.

3. **Phase 2: Specification**
   - Define safety requirements based on the risk assessment and safety goals.

4. **Phase 3: Validation Planning**
   - Plan validation activities to ensure that the safety requirements will be met.

5. **Phase 4: Realization**
   - Implement safety mechanisms in the design and development process.

6. **Phase 5: Verification**
   - Verify that the implementation meets the specified safety requirements.

7. **Phase 6: Code Simulation**
   - Simulate the code to identify and correct potential issues before physical testing.

8. **Phase 7: Validation**
   - Validate the final product to confirm it meets the overall safety objectives and is ready for production.

This life cycle ensures that safety is systematically addressed throughout the development process, from initial risk assessment to final validation.
