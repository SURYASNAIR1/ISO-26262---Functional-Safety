- SOTIF (ISO/PAS 21448): Safety of the intended functionality

- Comes in part 6 of ISO

- Safety of vehicles depends more and more on error-free software.

- Sw errors are defined to be systematic faults like incomplete test, wrong assumptions, incomplete specifications

- Sw faults must be avoided through systematic development

- The occurence of faults must be countered by mechanisms for fault tolerance eg: checksum for messages

- Functional safety requires the sw development process to be adapted to the content and requirements of ISO 26262.

# General topics for SW development
- Suitable SW development process

- Suitable sw development environment

- Modelling and coding guidelines

- FS is compatible with agil approaches and continuous integration

- Configuration and calibration data must be developed like software itself\

- Interface with cyber security


- Technical safety requirements must be detailed down to quality sw safety requirements.

- Safety analyses must be performed to understand the dependencies b/w s/w components and validate the s/w design.

# V model
- Specification of SW safety requirements

- SW architectural design

- SW unit design and implementation

- SW unit verification

- SW integration and verification

- Testing of the embedded SW
