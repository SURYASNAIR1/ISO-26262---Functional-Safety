# Specify hardware safety requirements

- Safety mechanisms

- Detection, indications and control of internal faults

- Failures external to the hardware

- Tolerance times

- Target values for hardware metrics and failure rates

# Hardware deign
- HW architectural design : implementing the hw safety requirements, observe criteria for coexistenxe in cases of different ASILs, traceability.

- HW detailed design

- Perform safety analyses
  
   Classify faults: safe faults, single point faults, residual faults, multiple-point faults

- Safety related special characteristics for production, operation, service and decommissioning

- HW integration and verification
 
  - Plan, specify, perform and evaluate hw integration and test/verification
 
  - Specify test cases using methods
 
  - Provide evidence of implementation of hw safety requirements
 
  - Provide evidence of robustness of HW
 
  - Apply funtion test and industy std. tests
